# Datadog Software Lifecycle Kubernetes Extravaganza

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This repo is a WIP and not yet ready to publish. It is being shared in this state internally in order to solicit feedback from the rest of the Datadog pack. To this end the README contents are being drafted in [google docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15buq4OED_VnvwBYKxPEYT5aJ7PPrlLhL_kCZUiOBOpk/edit?usp=sharing)

[![Main Autorelease](https://github.com/datadog/sdlc-gitops-sample-stack/actions/workflows/main-autorelease.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/datadog/sdlc-gitops-sample-stack/actions/workflows/main-autorelease.yaml)

This repo gives you a complete, cloneable, end-to-end demo of a golang/java stack hooked up to DataDog and Kubernetes. Rather than going service-by-service through a Kubernetes setup and then the Datadog integration, you can simply clone this repo, make some minor modifications to integrate into your environment, and get started. If you donâ€™t intend to run it as it is, it also provides a complete reference for how the different pieces come together.
