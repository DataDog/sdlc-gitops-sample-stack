## Create a PR to trigger builds

Now that we have the integration between Datadog and GitHub setup, we can stage a PR to update our fork of the repository so it is deployable in ArgoCD. This will also trigger a set of builds, which will now show up in Datadogâ€™s **CI Visibility** dashboard. 

Return to **GitHub**, go to **Actions**, and manually trigger the **Setup After Fork job**:

<p align='center'>
    <img alt="Trigger setup after fork job" src="assets/trigger-initial-build-setup-after-fork.jpeg" width="500px" />
</p>

This will create a branch on the repository with all the pieces referencing the current organization replaced with the location you've forked it to. Open a PR from the change. The PR dialog will will suggest opening a PR into the parent repository `datadog/sdlc-gitops-sample-stack`, which we don't want.
Change the target branch to you are merging into your forked repositories' `main` branch - in this example our forked repository is owned by `scottgerring`:
 
 <p align='center'>
    <img alt="Select target branch" src="assets/setup-initial-build-pr-dialog.jpeg" width="400px" />
</p>
 
 Next, select the `update-after-fork` branch as the source:

 <p align='center'>
    <img alt="Select source branch" src="assets/setup-initial-build-pr-dialog-2.jpeg" width="400px" />
</p>

You should see the actions for the various merge checks fire off and complete:

<p align='center'>
    <img alt="Setup after fork build results" src="assets/trigger-initial-build-setup-after-fork-results.jpeg" width="400px" />
</p>

Review the changes. You should see that the action has updated references to the repository which previously pointed at **datadog/sdlc-gitops-sample-stack** to point to your fork. Concretely this means:

* the ArgoCD application itself in **argocd-manifests** will now point at your GitHub repository  
* the container images for pass-api and pass-summary-api in **manifests** will now point at your GitHub hosted container images 
* the `service.datadog.yaml` **Service Catalog** manifest, which points service documentation links back to your Github repository

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You should see no other changes outside of these files\! 

Once you have validated this and seen the builds complete, merge to main. This will trigger the main build jobs. You can see them by clicking into the 
**Actions** tab:

<p align='center'>
    <img alt="Initial build action" src="assets/actions-initial-build.jpeg" width="600px" />
</p>

Wait for the build to complete, then validate that the images produced are visible in the Packages section of the repository home: 

<p align='center'>
    <img alt="Initial images released" src="assets/images-released.jpeg" width="600px" />
</p>

Now in addition to our own copy of the code, we've got container images for each service, hosted in our own GitHub that our GitOps manifests point at. 
Go back to the main page of the repository, select the branch drop-down where **main** is highlighted, and change to the **deploy** branch. This branch is updated each time the build actions for main complete successfully to point at the most recent set of released container images. 

<p align='center'>
    <img alt="Show dev environment image hashes" src="assets/setup-trigger-initial-build-show-branch.jpeg" width="600px" />
</p>

The idea here is for each ArgoCD deployment up to sync to this branch, and then each successful build will roll the image tags forward on the `deploy` automatically,  which will redeploy our development environment.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> We use a separate branch in this repository to keep things simple for this demo. For a production-grade deployment, we'd encourage you to use a seperate repository for your GitOps manifests!

Next up we will jump over to the Datadog console where we should now be able to see the results of our build runs as well as the service definitions showing the services we'll be deploying. [Onwards!](setup-dev-lifecycle-visibility.md)
